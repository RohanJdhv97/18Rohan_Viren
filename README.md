## Tresata Software

#### TREK
Data Inventory Engine built specifically to catalog, profile and report data ontology, quality and format attributes for all data in Hadoop. TREK rapidly profiles and inventories “as-is” data stored in Hadoop across all rows and columns to create an informed view of all valuable enterprise data feeds stored in a single Hadoop cluster.

TREK can be accessed via <tre-link-here>

For login, it is user **tresata** and password **admin**. After logging in, click on the menu icon next to the name "tresata" on the top right corner and select TREK.
You will see a list of datasets (please refer to [Data](#data) below) under "Project Name". Once you select a dataset in TREK, click on "Partitions" and select a partition (typically there is only one). You should now see a summary of all the columns in the dataset. Click on a column to get the statistics for that column. Keep in mind that we have only TREK'ed a sample table for each data source into Trek to give you an idea of what each data source looks like (schema, population of non-null values, number of unique values, top values, predicted patterns, etc).

**Please DO NOT delete any dataset in  TREK since all teams share the same TREK instance.**
