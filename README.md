Data Inventory Engine built specifically to catalog, profile and report data ontology, quality and format attributes for all data in Hadoop. TREK rapidly profiles and inventories “as-is” data stored in Hadoop across all rows and columns to create an informed view of all valuable enterprise data feeds stored in a single Hadoop cluster.
